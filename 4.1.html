            Edge detection,which measures,checks and captures discontinuity in pixel values in an image,is a basic problem in image analysis.The Inclined plane Decomposition based Non-symmetry and Anti-packing image representation Method(IDNAM),inspired by the concepts of the inclined plane fitting and anti-packing,uses a set of instances of the Rectangular Inclined Plane sub-pattern(RIP sub-pattern) to represent an image.On the basis of IDNAM,and ideal edge model within a RIP sub-pattern is presented.In the ideal edge model,edges within a RIP sub-pattern are divided into five types,and the methods for computing the edge strength and direction of the edges.The criterions for the existence of an edge within a RIP sub-pattern are presented,to separate between edge and noise.An edge detection algorithm is proposed based on IDNAM,according to the ideal edge model and the criterions.The theoretical analyses and experimental results show that the edge detection algorithm using IDNAM performs faster than the classical ones.</p>
